Owsinski [106] identified five key components to consider while
making a mix, and they are
• Balance,
• Spectrum,
• Space,
• Depth, and
• Dynamics.

The way in which a piece of music is mixed can heavily influence the way in which it is perceived, in terms of preference, perceived quality, and evoked emotion.

three different approaches for modelling the decision-making process in IMS:
- knowledge encoding,
- expert systems, 
- data-driven approaches (DeMan and Reiss [33])

======================================
I - knowledge encoding
"Grounded Theory"
ethnographic studies of mixing practice, interview, survey

approach limited to a set of rules
most approaches only automate one type of audio effect (balance with equal loudness, unmasking, transient with DRC, reverb,...)

important pour comprendre les pratiques de mix et ok pour de l'entrainement
mais ne permet pas d'"explorer" et de rencontrer des "heureux accidents" (Sérendipité)

======================================
II - Expert Systems

Modélisation du processus de décision humain
series of if-then-else rules

constraint optimisation problem: a serie of goals are defined, in a mathematical form, and the system must perform a search for the mathematically optimal solution

- approche des moindres carrés
- algorithme génétique
- Optimisation par essaims particulaires (modélisation de vol d'oiseau)

The inherent complexity of music mixing means that there is no certain optimal solution, but a number of different appropriate mixes given a set of contexts [64].

Expert-based system relies on the assumption that experts will make consistent, agreeable decisions.
This implies that experts should be considered to be time invariant—that an engineer who applies a given equaliser setting today would apply the same equaliser setting tomorrow, or next year.

======================================
III - Data Driven

These approaches rely on analysis on datasets or lots of example mixes and use this to extrapolate some set of mixing parameters.
discover how the audio features can be related to a specific mixing decision.

International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (pp. 212–218). ACM.

one of the largest restricting factors within a data-driven approach for intelligent mixing is data gathering.
And networks need to be able to deal with missing instruments, e.g. some tracks will have a brass section, or a violin track, but many will not, as Bittner et al. [9] identify that within their dataset only two of the 16 instruments exist in more than 50% of the multitracks.

"This system learns the full music production process of drum mixing and demonstrates that the intelligently produced mix is indistinguishable from the professional engineer-generated mix"


audio manipulation classique ou direct transformation du signal ? Semble plus souple et créative
(problème de l'ordre des traitements par exemple)
Music is a complex system, and the large multichannel signal modification required, with several different mapping layers and understanding the inter-correlation between different audio effect parameters, audio effect ordering in the signal chain, and processing approaches, makes this a highly complex and nonlinear search space

IV - Quel type d'interface humain-machine ?

différentes applications :
- aide à la décision/préprocessing vs. full automatic (personne devant la console)
- amateur vs. pro

Différents niveaux d'intéraction :
- Automatic,
- Independent, 
- Recommendation,
- Discovery.

Automatic:
- amateur
- benchmark mix
- video game

Independent: human supervisor
- repisse micro, recalage entre micro, démasquage
- pour amateur et pro

analogie avec les manoeuvres automatiques pour la voiture autonome

Recommendation: "suggestive mixing system"
- automatic labelling of instrument tracks
- adaptive audio effect parameter settings
- suggestion of the audio effect chain
- hierarchie de stem

Avantage : interprétable et adaptable

Discovery: 
- mix visualization
- comparaison avec un mix cible
- description qualitative (textuelle) ou quantitative (numérique) du mix

future:
- better understanding of the fundamentals of music
- help reduce laborious tasks of finding the appropriate sounds in libraries of millions of different sounds
- recommendation of alternative instrument (for the timbre) for voicing or re-voicing different melodies allows much greater control over the shape of the timbre.
- video game and augmented reality (mix added to the local soundscape!)
